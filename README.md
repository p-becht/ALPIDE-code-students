*Etiquette*:
If not communicated differently only your folder is your business
--> If you change code in other folders except your own without permission of the owner of the folder, I will banish you from the repository!
--> Exception of this rule is the "data" folder, which is open to changes from everyone. However, it is a good idea to communicate an intent of data deletion before action.
