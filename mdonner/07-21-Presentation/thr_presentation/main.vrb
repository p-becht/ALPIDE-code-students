\LARGE Definition of Threshold: \\[.5cm] \normalsize
    The Threshold is the minimum amount of charge to be deposited inside the
    sensitive region of the chip to create a sufficiently strong signal in
    order for the readout electronics to register an event \\[1cm]
    On ALPIDE: Threshold is defined mainly by two parameters: \verb`VCASN` and
    \verb`ITHR`. While increasing \verb`ITHR` increases the Threshold,
    augmenting \verb`VCASN` decreases it.
